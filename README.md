# Mislabeling_Coinference
1. Introduction ================ Mislabeling_Coinference is a Matlab-based software package for a simultaneous inference of generalised linear model parameters (implemented is logit-function) and of the category-specific mislabeling risks. The methodology is described in the following paper:  S. Gerber, L Pospisil, Ch. Hewel, M. Rueda, A. Hassanali and I. Horenko, "Co-inference of data mislabelings reveals improved models in breast cancer diagnostics and genomics", PNAS, 2018.  Mislabeling_Coinference is an open-sourced parallel Matlab-toolbox (under the General Public Licence), can be easily  extended or tailored for specific tasks, and scaled up for large data sets.  2. Availability ================ For academic uses, Mislabeling_Coinference-Toolbox is available free of charge.    Every usage of the methods   from this toolbox in publications should be acknowledged by a citation of the paper  mentioned above in the “Introduction”.
