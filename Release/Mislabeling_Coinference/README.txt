==================================================================

1. Introduction
================
Mislabeling_Coinference is a Matlab-based software package for a simultaneous inference of generalised linear model parameters (implemented is logit-function) and of the category-specific mislabeling risks. 

Mislabeling_Coinference is an open-sourced parallel Matlab-toolbox (under the General Public Licence), can be easily 
extended or tailored for specific tasks, and scaled up for large data sets.

2. Availability
================
For academic uses, Mislabeling_Coinference-Toolbox is available free of charge. 
  Every usage of the methods 
 from this toolbox in publications should be acknowledged by a citation of the paper
 mentioned above in the “Introduction”.

3. Installation
================
1) Requirements:  MATLAB, version 7.0 and higher; MATLAB Optimisation Toolbox Library. 
2) Download Mislabeling_Coinference.zip.
3) Create a directory and unzip the downloaded files into this directory.
4) Running the toolbox requires availability of the licences for the MATLAB-toolboxes “Optimisation” and “Parallel Computing”. 

4. How to start?
==================
1) Start up MATLAB. 
2) Run “Example_BIRADS_data_analysis.m” (Example 1 from the above-mentioned paper) for demos.
